# Calculating a 2x2 Matrix Determinant

The determinant of a 2x2 matrix is one of the fundamental calculations in linear algebra. Here's how to do it step by step.

## The Formula

For a 2x2 matrix:
```
|a b|
|c d|
```

The determinant is calculated as: `det = ad - bc`

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Identify the Elements
First, identify the elements of your matrix:
- Top-left (a)
- Top-right (b)
- Bottom-left (c)
- Bottom-right (d)

### 2. Main Diagonal
Multiply the elements on the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):
- Result = a × d

### 3. Secondary Diagonal
Multiply the elements on the secondary diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):
- Result = b × c

### 4. Final Calculation
Subtract the secondary diagonal product from the main diagonal product:
- Determinant = (a × d) - (b × c)

## Example

Let's calculate the determinant of:
```
|2 3|
|4 5|
```

1. Identify elements:
   - a = 2, b = 3
   - c = 4, d = 5

2. Main diagonal:
   - 2 × 5 = 10

3. Secondary diagonal:
   - 3 × 4 = 12

4. Final calculation:
   - det = 10 - 12 = -2

## Properties to Remember

- If the determinant is zero, the matrix is singular (non-invertible)
- The determinant can be positive or negative
- The determinant represents the area scaling factor of the linear transformation

## Practice Problems

Try calculating these determinants:
1. |1 2|
   |3 4|

2. |5 0|
   |0 5|

3. |2 1|
   |-1 2|
